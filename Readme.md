\# ENPM661 Planning for Autonomous Robots - Project 2

\# Implementation of the **Dijkstra Algorithm** for a Point Robot

\# Run the file 'dijkstra\_vipul\_patel.py' to execute the algorithm.

- Enter the start_node and goal_node in the appropriate range mentioned and the output screen will display the exploration of nodes and the optimal path to the goal node.


\# Important Libraries used: 
- cv2 - To simulate the optimal path on the output screen.
- math - Perform basic mathematical operations.
- time – Used to calculate the time taken to process the optimal path.
- Heapq -  To store nodes.
- numpy – To perform mathematical operations on array


\# Description of Map:(Snap of the Map with obstacles is uploaded with .py file) 
- Objects in the red are obstacles
- The obstacles are bloated by 5 mm distance on each side shown in blue color to provide clearance.
- The node exploration is shown by green color
- The otimal path to the goal node is shown with red line


\# A sample video with start\_node as [130,125] and goal\_node as [180,150] is uploaded with the .py file
